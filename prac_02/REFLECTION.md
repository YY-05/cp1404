Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I plan to watch all the lecture videos before writing my prac works. I may watch the lecture videos at home or in the school library. And I watch the lecture video for about an hour each time, then take a break and watch the rest of the video.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I do well in this subject so far that I will keep doing is naming functions, docstrings, decision structures, 5 common patterns

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to speed up my process, and I always write pseudocode before writing code to help me organize the structure of the program. I know this will waste my time.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I will complete each of my tasks carefully, and actively seek help from teachers or classmates when I encounter something I donâ€™t understand, to strengthen my understanding of the basic knowledge.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Not really well, but I try my best to complete it.
